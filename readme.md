# Code structure

- SSAS_main.m
    main program for implementing SSAS.

- functions/
    functions required by SSAS_main.m
    The conversion between spherical harmonics (SH) and surface grids (longitude, 
    latitude, Z-value, or LLZ) is realized based on the software SHbundle 
    (https://www.gis.uni-stuttgart.de/en/research/downloads/shbundle/). 
    The required codes have been included here.
- data/
  - csr06_gsm_2004-12_2005-02.mat
      The input of three months' gravity products in the form of SH.
  - LLZ_mask_three_separate.mat
      Three mask files for 1) Sumatra, 2) Antarctica, and 3) Greenland.

- check/
    Two figures for validation of the figures generated by SSAS_main.m
- ex_read-SH-files
    An example to illustrate how an ASCII file can be converted to the data format used here.
    Note that these raw GSM data require special processing for the low degree coefficients 
    and to be subtracted from the reference field, which are not provided here.
